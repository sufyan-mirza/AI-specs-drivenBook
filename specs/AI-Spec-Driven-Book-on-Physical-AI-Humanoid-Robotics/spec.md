## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Learning Core Concepts and Reproducible Examples (Priority: P1)

As a student learning robotics, AI, and embodied intelligence, I want to understand the core concepts of Physical AI and humanoid robotics, and be able to reproduce all code examples and simulations, so that I can gain practical experience and deepen my understanding.

**Why this priority**: This directly addresses the fundamental learning objective for students, providing both theoretical understanding and essential hands-on reproducibility, which is critical for academic and practical application.

**Independent Test**: The student can follow a chapter's tutorial, execute its provided code/simulation, and achieve the described outcome without external assistance, demonstrating successful learning and reproducibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a chapter explaining a Physical AI concept, **When** I follow the associated tutorial, **Then** I can successfully run the provided ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, or Isaac Sim example.
2. **Given** a code example, **When** I execute it in my environment, **Then** the simulation/robot behavior matches the book's description.

### User Story 2 - Transitioning to Physical Robot Systems (Priority: P1)

As an engineer transitioning from digital AI to physical robot systems, I want to learn about Physical AI systems that integrate ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac, including an end-to-end vision-language-action pipeline using Whisper + LLMs, so that I can apply these advanced techniques to build and control physical robots.

**Why this priority**: This targets engineers seeking practical knowledge to bridge the gap from theoretical/digital AI to tangible physical systems, offering a high-value skill transfer path.

**Independent Test**: The engineer can successfully implement and demonstrate the full LLM-to-ROS action translation pipeline, taking voice input and translating it to cognitive planning and robot action within a simulated environment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a description of integrating ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac, **When** I attempt to set up a similar integrated system, **Then** I can successfully run a basic Physical AI simulation.
2. **Given** the LLM-to-ROS action pipeline tutorial, **When** I follow the steps, **Then** I can demonstrate a voice command translating into a robot action in the simulation.

### User Story 3 - Building Physical-AI-focused Curricula (Priority: P2)

As an educator or institution building Physical-AI-focused curricula, I want a comprehensive resource that clearly explains Physical AI, embodied intelligence, and humanoid robotics, with verifiable citations and a complete Docusaurus website and PDF version, so that I can develop high-quality, academically rigorous courses.

**Why this priority**: This enables wider adoption and structured learning within educational settings, expanding the book's impact beyond individual learners.

**Independent Test**: The educator can utilize the book's content, verify its citations, and confirm the Docusaurus/PDF outputs, and then construct a coherent course module directly from the book.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a scientific claim in the book, **When** I check the APA citation, **Then** I can trace it back to a peer-reviewed source.
2. **Given** the Docusaurus website and PDF, **When** I review them, **Then** they are complete, well-formatted, and reflect the book's content accurately.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a code example or simulation fails to run due to environmental differences? The book should provide clear troubleshooting steps or environment setup guidelines.
- How does the system handle potential inconsistencies or updates in external dependencies (ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac)? The book should specify versions used and provide guidance on managing version discrepancies.
- What if the total word count exceeds the maximum limit or falls below the minimum? A content review and adjustment process will be required.
- How are sensitive topics like ethical implications of humanoid robotics addressed, given the focus on practical engineering? These should be discussed in relevant sections.
