# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation — Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy through primary technical verification
Every factual and technical claim MUST be directly verifiable against authoritative sources, specifically ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac official documentation. This principle ensures the highest level of technical correctness and prevents the dissemination of unverified information.

### Clarity for academic/technical audience
All content, explanations, and code examples MUST be crafted for an academic and technical audience with a background in computer science and robotics. This principle ensures the material is accessible, understandable, and valuable to its target readership, avoiding oversimplification or unnecessary jargon.

### Reproducibility
All tutorials, code examples, and simulations MUST run exactly as described without error or ambiguity. This principle is critical for hands-on learning, enabling readers to replicate experiments and deepen their understanding through practical application.

### Rigor
The book's content MUST primarily draw from peer-reviewed robotics and AI research articles. While other sources may supplement, a minimum of 50% of all citations MUST originate from peer-reviewed literature to maintain academic integrity and scientific credibility.

### Spec-driven development
Each chapter and its associated technical content MUST be developed using Spec-Kit Plus specifications. This structured approach ensures comprehensive coverage, consistency, and traceability of requirements and implementations throughout the book's creation process.

### Docusaurus-native deployment
The entire book MUST be written, structured, and deployed using Docusaurus. This principle mandates adherence to Docusaurus-compatible formatting, markdown standards, and best practices to ensure a seamless, high-quality online publication experience.

## Key Standards

All factual and technical claims must be traceable to authoritative sources.
Citation format: APA style.
Source types: minimum 50% peer-reviewed research articles.
Plagiarism check: 0% tolerance before publication.
Writing clarity: Flesch-Kincaid grade 10–12.
Code reproducibility: ROS 2 + Gazebo + Unity + Isaac Sim examples must run.
Docusaurus-compatible formatting and markdown standards must be follow.

## Development Guidelines

Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices and guidelines. Amendments require formal documentation, approval, and a clear migration plan if changes impact existing content or workflows. All pull requests and reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Complexity in any solution MUST be explicitly justified against the core principles of simplicity and clarity.
